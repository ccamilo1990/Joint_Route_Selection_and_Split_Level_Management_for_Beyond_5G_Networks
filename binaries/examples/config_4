# Select the algorithm to run: 1. Exhaustive, 2. Greedy, 3. Genetic.
algorithm 3
# The evolutionary algorithm with intelligent initialization (EA^gre) is chosen by setting the initialization parameter to 1.
initialization 1
# For genetic algorithms, we can modify various parameters, including the number of generations (or number of iterations).
iterations 300
# Another parameter that we can vary corresponds to the number of genes to modify during the mutation process (the value must be a positive integer).
mutation 3
# The parameter of percentage of crossed genes allows us to control the quantity of genes exchanged during the process of crossing the individuals (solutions).
crossover 0.5
# The ranking parameter allows us to determine the number of solutions to be compared in case the solutions do not meet the restrictions.
ranking 0.45
# Population refers to the number of individuals (or solutions) that will be selected during each generation.
population 100
